# Project Description for Applications

## TOMATO - Full-Stack Food Delivery Platform

I'm most proud of **TOMATO**, a full-stack food delivery platform I built from scratch. This project showcases my ability to develop end-to-end web applications with modern technologies.

**What I Built:**
- **Customer-facing web app** with menu browsing, shopping cart, order placement, and payment processing
- **Admin dashboard** for managing food items, orders, and analytics
- **RESTful API backend** with secure authentication, database management, and file upload handling

**Technical Highlights:**
- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Clerk authentication
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Key Features**: 
  - Integrated Clerk for secure user authentication
  - Razorpay payment gateway integration
  - Image upload system for food items
  - Responsive, mobile-first design
  - RESTful API with proper error handling and logging
  - Environment-based deployment configuration

**What Makes It Special:**
This project demonstrates my full-stack capabilities - from designing the database schema and API endpoints to building intuitive user interfaces. I implemented proper security measures, error handling, and production-ready deployment configurations. The codebase follows best practices with modular architecture, comprehensive logging, and well-documented code.

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Managed complex state across multiple components (cart, user data, food items)
- Implemented secure file upload and storage system
- Configured CORS and environment variables for different deployment stages
- Integrated third-party services (Clerk, Razorpay) seamlessly
- Built responsive UI that works across all device sizes

**Deployment:**
The application is deployed with:
- Backend API on Render/Heroku
- Frontend and Admin panel on Vercel
- MongoDB Atlas for database hosting
